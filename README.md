_Customer Service and Front Office Team Lead_

- Reported directly to COO.

This led to collaborating with the tech team to design and implement automation of the onboarding processes for several product campaigns.

## Skills

#### Communication
My experience working on group/cross-departmental projects and leading and training team members, whilst also providing excellent customer service has given me the ability to communicate effectively in a variety of situations about a multitude of topics. 

#### Problem Solving

- I played an instrumental part in transitioning an admin/customer service department that ran very manually (think copying and pasting from spreadsheets and putting post in envelopes by hand), to customer processes becoming almost fully automated, enabling my team to focus on the customers instead of doing manual tasks.
- I was able to manipulate customer data and visualise it in a way that was easily readable for management insights.
- I used Google Apps scripts to add automation to Google sheets which were used by my team for daily tasks, to make them more user friendly and efficient.

#### Leadership
In my previous role I was responsible for leading and overseeing the customer service team, aswell as leading on the ongoing review and improvememt of processes within the department, training the team on any changes or updates to processes, and managing any feedback or issues that arose.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2023 to July 2023)
- Ruby, Git, TDD

#### Leeds Metropolitan University (September 2008 to June 2011)

- BA(Hons) Fine Art
- 2:2
- Aside from giving me my creative flair, this is where I started to hone my communication and team work skills, all the group crits, presentations and exhibitions were the ideal environments to learn group organization, and to be able to give and recieve constructive criticism. 

#### Fitness Industry Education (September 2015 to January 2016)

- REPS Level 3 Certificate in Personal Training
- My time as a PT was quite brief, but definitely gave me a push to develop my communication and leadership skills further. Training beginners to a confident level meant being able to break down complicated or scientific concepts and explain them in a simple way, whilst keeping the client motivated and engaged throughout a challenging workout.

## Hobbies

- The gym, especially weightlifting - More than anything, this has given me a mental discipline that I have carried through into other areas of my life.
- Bouldering - I'm very much a beginner, but it's working out combined with problem solving, need I say more!
- Music and creative arts - I love attending concerts, exhibitions etc.
- Yoga or a good hike/country walk - The best antidote to sitting at a computer all day.
